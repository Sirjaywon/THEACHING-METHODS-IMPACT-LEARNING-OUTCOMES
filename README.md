# THEACHING-METHODS-IMPACT-LEARNING-OUTCOMES
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
**OBJECTIVES**

To determine if there is a significant difference in student performance across different teaching methods.

**SCOPE**

The analysis covers:
- Evaluates student performance under different teaching methods.
- Compares academic outcomes across the selected teaching methods.
- Determines if observed differences are statistically significant.
- Focuses on a specific group of students within the study period.
- Limited to the teaching methods and performance measures chosen for the study.
  
**METHODOLOGY**
- Research Design: Quantitative, comparative study using an experimental or quasi-experimental design.
- Population: All students enrolled in the selected educational institution or program during the study period.
- Sample: A representative group of students divided into subgroups according to the teaching method used. Sampling method may be random or purposive depending on availability.
- Data Collection Method: Administer standardized tests or assessments to measure student performance after applying the teaching methods.
- Variables:
Independent Variable – Teaching method (e.g., Method A, Method B, Method C).
Dependent Variable – Student performance (e.g., test scores).
- Data Analysis:
Check assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances.
Use One-Way ANOVA to compare mean scores across teaching methods.
Conduct post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) if ANOVA shows significant results.
- Ethical Considerations: Obtain consent from participants, ensure confidentiality of data, and follow institutional research ethics guidelines.

**DATA SOURCE**:
The data was given by a text data in a pdf format which was downlaoded and processed for analysis
